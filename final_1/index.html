        <h3>information about me (pls no dox)</h3>
        <article>I was born in India, but I moved to the US when I was two years old. Since then, I have lived in
            Shoreview. I
            went to Island Lake Elementary and Chippewa Middle school. I am currently in Mounds view High school and
            plan to go to college after high school. Outside of school, I like to play Minecraft, solve Rubik's cubes,
            and do taekwondo. I am (was) really good at soplving Rubik's cubes, but I have now fallen out of practice.
            Something I am hilariously bad at doing is <s>nothing</s> guessing where i am on google maps in 0.1 seconds
            but the image is black and white, inverted, scrambled, AND i can only see the telephone poles. However, this
            is a skill I am working on. i like chocolate ice cream and currently have no pets.
