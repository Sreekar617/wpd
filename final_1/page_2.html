        <article>
            <p> I love their burrito bowl, which is basically everything you could ask for from a burrito without the
                tortilla. I find that they are much easier to eat, and the portions are <b>much</b> bigger than some
                other
                burrito bowls I've eaten
                (<em>*cough&hairsp;&hairsp;cough&hairsp;&hairsp;<b>schoolfood</b>&hairsp;&hairsp;cough&hairsp;&hairsp;cough*</em>).
            </p>

            <p>Chipotle restaurants are always adding new items to their menus. For example, they recently
                added smoked brisket to their menu.</p>

            <p> However, my favorite parts of the burrito bowl are the toppings, though i never get the new limited time
                toppings. I like their guacamole, which is visibly
                fresh and super creamy and the fajita
                veggies which are multicolored peppers and onions that taste really good. The thing that sets Chipotle
                apart
                from their competitors is their use of fresh ingredients that look like they were prepared on the spot.
                Chipotle doesnâ€™t mess around with their uses of spices either, unlike some other burrito bowls I know
                (<em>*cough&hairsp;&hairsp;cough&hairsp;&hairsp;hack&hairsp;&hairsp;cough&hairsp;&hairsp;hack&hairsp;&hairsp;hack&hairsp;&hairsp;cough&hairsp;&hairsp;cough&hairsp;&hairsp;cough&hairsp;&hairsp;<b>schoolfood</b>&hairsp;&hairsp;cough&hairsp;&hairsp;cough*</em>)
                <br><br>best of all they have <strong>rice</strong>
