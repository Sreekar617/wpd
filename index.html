		<h3>personal info (<strong>pls no dox</strong>)</h3>
		<article>I was born in India, but I moved to the US when I was two years old. Since then, I have lived in
			Shoreview. I
			went to Island Lake Elementary and Chippewa Middle school. I am currently in Mounds view High school and
			plan to go to college after high school. Outside of school, I like to play Minecraft, solve Rubik's cubes,
			and do taekwondo. I am (was) really good at soplving Rubik's cubes, but I have now fallen out of practice.
			Something I am hilariously bad at doing is <s>nothing</s> guessing where i am on google maps in 0.1 seconds
			but the image is black and white, inverted, scrambled, AND i can only see the telephone poles. However, this
			is a skill I am working on. i currently have no formal job, but I go to mounds view high school.
